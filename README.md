# Problem Statement
Test the following hypothesis:
"The energy distribution of the single particle showers produced by CWGAN-GP is statistically indistinguishable from that of Geant4, meaning the generated data accurately represents Geant4 showers"

# Why is it important?
Simulation is essential requirement for comparing with actual data from CERN for analysis of high energy experiments. Traditionally simulation is done by Geant4, a resource intensive tool.
This model conditional WGAN-gradient penalty created at University of Bologna is a fast, lightweight alternate to traditional resource intensive simulation tool (Geant4) for the particle physics ATLAS experiment at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. 

# Goal
The project compares two distributions and evaluates the goodness of fit with reduced chi squares χ²/ndf as the metric. 
One distribution is energy distribution Geant4 from dataset  (csvFiles, rootFiles, binning.xml), the other is distribution is generated by the conditional WGAN-GP model.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)


## My task
I optimized the following hyperparameters:
- architecture of the generator (width and depth)
- the latent space which is input into the generator
- the learning rate of the generator discriminator
- the gradient penalty of the model

## Results

- Python for data analysis of csv, root, binning.xml files: matplotlib, uproot, pandas, numpy, tensorboard
- Singularity containerization
- HTCondor job submission at LXBATCH
- LaTex
